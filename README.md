# Definitions
1. probability - study of random events
2. statistics - discipline of using data samples to support claims about populations, most statistical analysis is based on probability

# Chapter 1: Statistical Thinking for Programmers
Anectodal evidence usually fails because:
* small number of observations
* selection bias
* confirmation bias
* inaccuracy

Statistical tools:
* data collection
* descriptive statistics
* exploratory data analysis
* hypothesis testing
* estimation - using data from a sample to estimate characteristics of the general population

## The National Survey of Family Growth
National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) is conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to gather "information on family life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy, infertility, use of contraception, and men's and women's health. The results are used ... to plan health services and health education programs, and to do statistical studies of families, fertility, and health". 
* cross-sectional study - captures a snapshot of a group at a point in time (e.g. NSFG), meant to be representative
* longitudinal study - observes a group repeatedly over a period of time
* cycle - each deployement or instance that a survey is conducted
* respondents - people who participate in a survey
* cohort - group of respondents
* representative - every member of the target population has an equal chance of participating
* oversampling - deliberately sampling groups at rates higher than their representation in a population, used to make sure that group is large enough to draw valid statistical inferences, drawback is that it is not as easy to draw conclusions about the general population
